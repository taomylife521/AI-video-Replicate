### Style
* **Visual Texture:** Digital crispness with the characteristic high-definition look of a smartphone recording. The surfaces of the dolls' plastic skin and synthetic hair are smooth and reflective, while the fabrics of their clothing (denim, polyester, and knit) show subtle threading.
* **Lighting Quality:** Natural diffused light, likely from a nearby window, supplemented by soft indoor ambient lighting. There is a gentle glow emanating from the LED heart-shaped lights on the dolls' chests.
* **Color Palette:** Vibrant and high-contrast, dominated by saturated primary and secondary colors: fiery red, deep purple, cobalt blue, and bright orange, set against the neutral beige and wood tones of a domestic interior.
* **Atmosphere:** Playful, enthusiastic, and commercial-like, capturing a sense of childhood wonder and the excitement of a new toy.

### Cinematography
* **Camera:** Handheld with dynamic movements including close-ups, slight pans, and a slow digital zoom. The camera stays at a low-angle relative to the dolls to emphasize their features.
* **Lens:** Standard smartphone wide-angle lens with a deep focus, ensuring both the dolls in the foreground and the girl/background remain relatively clear.
* **Lighting:** Soft natural light illuminates the scene from the side, creating soft shadows and highlighting the glowing LED effects.
* **Mood:** Upbeat, joyful, and intimate.
