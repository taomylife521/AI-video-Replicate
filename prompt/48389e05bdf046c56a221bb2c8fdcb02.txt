### Style
* **Visual Texture:** AI-generated digital video with a hyper-smooth, slightly waxy texture. There is a dreamlike, "uncanny valley" quality where details like fingers, doll faces, and hair exhibit fluid, morphing movements common in generative AI.
* **Lighting Quality:** Soft, diffused indoor lighting. The scenes are brightly lit with a warm, domestic glow, simulating natural light from windows and warm overhead fixtures.
* **Color Palette:** Vibrant and saturated. Dominant colors include the bright purples, blues, and yellows of the doll packaging, contrasted with festive reds and greens from the Christmas-themed bedding and decor.
* **Atmosphere:** Whimsical and heartwarming. The video captures a "magical morning" or "Christmas surprise" vibe, though the AI artifacts lend it a surreal, ethereal quality.

### Cinematography
* **Camera:** Primarily static medium shots and close-ups. There are subtle, slow-drifting movements (simulated dolly shots) that keep the focus centered on the mother and child.
* **Lens:** Medium focal length with a moderately shallow depth of field. The background (Christmas trees, bedroom furniture) remains visible but slightly soft to emphasize the subjects in the foreground.
* **Lighting:** Soft-box style lighting that eliminates harsh shadows, creating a commercial-like "perfect" home environment.
* **Mood:** Joyful, affectionate, and festive.
