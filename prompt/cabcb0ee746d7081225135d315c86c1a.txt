### Style
* **Visual Texture:** Photorealistic with a cinematic digital polish. The surface of the mug features high-relief, 3D-molded textures that mimic the matte plastic and metallic sheen of real tools. The workshop scenes feature fine details like dust motes dancing in light and wood grain textures.
* **Lighting Quality:** Cinematic "golden hour" lighting. Natural, warm sunlight streams through workshop windows, creating soft rim lighting around the mug and long, dramatic shadows.
* **Color Palette:** Dominated by deep blacks and warm amber tones. Accents of safety yellow, industrial orange, and metallic silver from the tools provide a high-contrast, vibrant pop against the dark ceramic.
* **Atmosphere:** Nostalgic and cozy yet industrious. It evokes the feeling of a quiet, productive morning in a well-loved personal workshop.

### Cinematography
* **Camera:** A mix of extreme close-ups and medium shots. The camera remains mostly steady with subtle handheld micro-movements to give it a personal, "first-person" feel.
* **Lens:** Macro lens used for detail shots of the mug's texture; a portrait-length lens (approx. 50mm-85mm) for other shots to create a shallow depth of field, beautifully blurring the workshop and kitchen backgrounds (bokeh).
* **Lighting:** Soft key light from the side, supplemented by strong practical sunlight (backlighting/rim lighting) to emphasize the steam rising from the coffee.
* **Mood:** Intimate, satisfying, and appreciative of craftsmanship.

### Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1 (0:00s - 0:01s):**
An extreme close-up of a black ceramic mug. A person’s fingers are shown tracing the tactile, embossed tools built into the side of the cup—specifically a yellow tape measure and a pair of pliers. The lighting is warm and directional, highlighting the 3D relief of the design.

**Actions:**
* Fingers gently touch and probe the molded tools on the mug's surface.
* Subtle shifts in light as the mug is slightly tilted.

**Dialogue:**
* Narrator (Warm/Informative): "Looking for a gift that makes auto mechanics smile?"

**Background Sound:**
* Soft, upbeat acoustic guitar or lo-fi background track; ambient workshop sounds (distant bird chirps or wind).

**Scene 2 (0:01s - 0:07s):**
The shot pulls back to a medium view in a rustic, sun-drenched workshop. A hand holds the black toolbox mug, which is filled with steaming hot coffee. The background is filled with vintage tools, wooden beams, and a red toolbox. Sunbeams cut through the air, illuminating floating dust and the rising steam.

**Actions:**
* The mug is held steadily in the frame.
* Thick, wispy steam rises vertically from the coffee.
* The camera pans slightly to show the workshop environment.

**Dialogue:**
* Narrator (Warm/Informative): "This toolbox coffee mug is perfect. An 11-ounce cup designed like a mechanic's tool set. Funny, unique, and practical for daily coffee."

**Background Sound:**
* Continuous background music; the faint sound of steam/heat (subtle hiss).

**Scene 3 (0:07s - 0:11s):**
The setting shifts to a cozy home kitchen. The mug is held in the foreground, while a dining table with plates and framed family photos are visible in the soft-focus background. The lighting remains warm, suggesting a breakfast setting.

**Actions:**
* The hand rotates the mug slightly to show the different tools (hammer, screwdriver, wrench).
* Subtle breathing movement from the person holding the mug.

**Dialogue:**
* Narrator (Warm/Informative): "Great for..." (Cut off by TikTok logo).

**Background Sound:**
* Music swells slightly; ambient domestic kitchen sounds.
